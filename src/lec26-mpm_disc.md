# Spatial and Temporal Discretization

In the first lecture [Discrete Space Time](./lec1-discrete_space_time.md), we introduced various approaches for discretizing deformable solids. Rather than starting from classical continuum equations, we directly formulated elasticity simulations as discrete algebraic problems, with previous discussions primarily focusing on purely Lagrangian schemes.

In this lecture, we introduce the Material Point Method (MPM)â€”a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian numerical scheme particularly suited for simulating large deformation, topology changes, and history-dependent materials. Unlike purely Lagrangian methods (e.g., [Finite Element Method](./lec19-linear_FEM.md)), which track material deformation through defining the **mesh topology and connectivity**, MPM discretizes the material into a set of independent **material particles** ([Section 26.1](./lec26.1-material_particles.md)). Each particle stores essential physical information such as mass, momentum, deformation gradient, and stress. MPM utilizes a temporary, regular Cartesian background grid to exchange information between particles and grid nodes ([Section 26.2](./lec26.2-interpolating_functions.md) and [Section 26.3](./lec26.3-euler_lag_transfers.md)).

At each time step, information from material particles is first transferred onto the Eulerian computational grid, where governing equations are solved efficiently. Updated grid solutions are then transferred back onto the particles, updating particle states such as position and deformation gradient ([Section 26.4](./lec26.4-particle_state_update.md)). After this transfer, the grid is reset, leaving particles as the sole carriers of material history. This hybrid strategy naturally accommodates significant deformation and complex contact scenarios, effectively overcoming typical mesh-distortion challenges inherent to traditional purely Lagrangian methods.
