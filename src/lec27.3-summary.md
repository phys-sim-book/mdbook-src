## Summary

This section introduced how MPM incorporates plastic material behavior through the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and plastic parts. We discussed how stress is computed from the elastic component, while plastic flow evolves to enforce material-specific yield conditions. The return mapping algorithm ensures that stresses remain admissible by projecting the trial state back onto the yield surface.
