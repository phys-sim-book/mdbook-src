## Eulerian-Lagrangian Transfers

In MPM, the material state is stored on **Lagrangian particles**, while the [Governing Equations](./lec16-strong_and_weak_forms.md) (e.g., conservation of momentum) are solved on a temporary **Eulerian grid**. Therefore, we must transfer information between particles and grid nodes at each time step.

This section discusses how **mass**, **momentum**, and **internal forces (stress)** are transferred from particles to grid (P2G), and how updated velocities are transferred back from grid to particles (G2P).



### Particle-to-Grid (P2G) Transfers

**Mass Transfer**: Let $m_p$ be the mass of particle $p$, and $w_{\mathbf{i}p} = N_\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{x}_p)$ be the interpolation weight ([Section 25.2](./lec25.2-interpolating_functions.md)) between grid node $\mathbf{i}$ and particle $p$. We transfer mass to grid node $\mathbf{i}$ by summing:

$$
m_\mathbf{i} = \sum_p w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, m_p
$$

**Momentum Transfer**: Similarly, particle velocity $\mathbf{v}_p$ is used to compute nodal momentum:

$$
(m \mathbf{v})_\mathbf{i} = \sum_p w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, m_p \mathbf{v}_p
$$

Then, the **nodal velocity** of each grid node is:

$$
\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i} = \frac{(m \mathbf{v})_\mathbf{i}}{m_\mathbf{i}}
$$

**Internal Force (Stress) Transfer**: In MPM, forces are defined on grid nodes where [Newtonâ€™s second law](./lec1.2-newton_2nd_law.md) is applied. For hyperelastic materials, the internal elastic force can be derived either from the [Weak Form](./lec16.3-weak_form.md) of the momentum equation or from the gradient of the total [Potential Energy](./lec13.1-rigid_null_rot_inv.md). The latter is often preferred when a well-defined energy density is available.

Assuming a deformation-gradient-based hyperelastic energy density $\Psi_p(\mathbf{F}_p)$ at each particle $p$, the total potential energy of the system is:

$$
\mathcal{E} = \sum_p V_p^0 \, \Psi_p(\mathbf{F}_p)
$$

where $V_p^0$ is the rest volume of particle $p$. The elastic force acting on grid node $i$ is then computed as the negative gradient of the total energy with respect to the nodal position $\mathbf{x}_\mathbf{i}$:

$$
\mathbf{f}_\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{x}) = - \frac{\partial \mathcal{E}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_\mathbf{i}} = - \sum_p V_p^0 \, \frac{\partial \Psi_p}{\partial \mathbf{F}}(\mathbf{F}_p(\mathbf{x})) \, \mathbf{F}_p^T \, \nabla w_{\mathbf{i}p}
$$

In the case of explicit time integration such as Symplectic Euler, the force is evaluated at the current time step $n$:

$$
\mathbf{f}_\mathbf{i}^n = - \sum_p V_p^0 \, \frac{\partial \Psi_p}{\partial \mathbf{F}}\left(\mathbf{F}_p^n\right) \, (\mathbf{F}_p^n)^T \, \nabla w_{\mathbf{i}p}^n
$$

This formulation expresses the force on grid node $i$ due to the elastic stress contributions from nearby particles. It depends entirely on known particle attributes and interpolation weights at the current time step.

### Grid Update

The grid performs an update using:

$$
\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^{n+1} = \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^n + \frac{\Delta t}{m_\mathbf{i}} (\mathbf{f}_\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{f}_\mathbf{i}^{\text{ext}})
$$

Boundary treatments are also enforced during this stage and will be discussed in detail in later sections.

### Grid-to-Particle (G2P) Transfers

Once the grid velocity $\mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^{n+1}$ is updated, we need to transfer information back to the particles. The main quantity to update with the G2P transfer is the particle velocity $\mathbf{v}_p^{n+1}$, which will be used in the advection step ([Section 25.4](src/lec25.4-particle_state_update.md)).

The simplest approach is to interpolate velocity directly from the grid:

$$
\mathbf{v}_p^{n+1} = \sum_\mathbf{i} w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^{n+1}
$$

This naive scheme is part of the **PIC method**, but it is highly diffusive. In practice, we often adopt improved transfer schemes to better preserve velocity modes and conserve momentum.

### Different Transfer Schemes

Transfer schemes define how **P2G and G2P** work together. Different methods balance numerical stability, energy conservation, and physical realism.

> {{exp}}{exp:lec25:pic}[PIC, Particle-in-Cell] $$ $$
**P2G**: Only particle velocity $\mathbf{v}_p$ is transferred to the grid using:
$$
(m\mathbf{v})_\mathbf{i} = \sum_p w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, m_p \mathbf{v}_p
$$
**G2P**: Particle velocity is interpolated directly from grid:
$$
\mathbf{v}_p^{n+1} = \sum_\mathbf{i} w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^{n+1}
$$
PIC is very stable and conserves linear momentum, but suffers from high numerical dissipation, loss of fine-scale motion, and does not conserve angular momentum.

> {{exp}}{exp:lec25:pic}[FLIP ,Fluid-Implicit-Particle] $$ $$
**P2G**: Same as PIC. $$ $$
**G2P**: In FLIP, the particle velocity is updated by blending the newly interpolated velocity and the change in velocity between time steps:
$$
\mathbf{v}_p^{n+1} =
\sum_\mathbf{i} w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^{n+1}
+ \alpha \left( \mathbf{v}_p^n - \sum_\mathbf{i} w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^n \right)
$$
where $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ is the **FLIP-PIC blending factor** (with $\alpha = 1$ recovering full FLIP and 0.99 usually). This update preserves the particle's deviation from the grid's average motion.
The position is then updated by:
$$
\mathbf{x}_p^{n+1} = \mathbf{x}_p^n + \Delta t \sum_\mathbf{i} w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^{n+1}
$$
FLIP preserves kinetic energy and detailed motion over long time scales, making it ideal for simulating fluids with minimal numerical dissipation. However, due to its lack of inherent smoothing, it can introduce noise, penetration, or even instability in solid simulations.

> {{exp}}{exp:lec25:pic}[APIC, Affine Particle-in-Cell)] $$ $$
APIC @@jiang2015affine introduces **affine velocity fields** to more accurately model local particle motion and preserve angular momentum. Each particle stores an affine velocity matrix $\mathbf{C}_p$ in addition to its velocity $\mathbf{v}_p$. The particle velocity field is written as:
$$
\mathbf{v}_p(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{v}_p + \mathbf{C}_p (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_p)
$$
**P2G**: The momentum transfer includes affine motion:
$$
(m\mathbf{v})_\mathbf{i} = \sum_p w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, m_p \left( \mathbf{v}_p + \mathbf{C}_p (\mathbf{x}_\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{x}_p) \right)
$$
This enables particles to transfer both linear and angular momentum to the grid. $$ $$
**G2P**: After the grid update, particle velocity and affine matrix are reconstructed from grid values:
$$
\mathbf{v}_p^{n+1} = \sum_\mathbf{i} w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^{n+1}
$$
$$
\mathbf{B}_p^{n+1} = \mathbf{D}_p^{-1} \sum_\mathbf{i} w_{\mathbf{i}p} \, \mathbf{v}_\mathbf{i}^{n+1} (\mathbf{x}_\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{x}_p)^T
$$
Here, $\mathbf{D}_p$ is a second moment matrix defined as:
$$
\mathbf{D}_p = \sum_\mathbf{i} w_{\mathbf{i}p} (\mathbf{x}_\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{x}_p)(\mathbf{x}_\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{x}_p)^T
$$
For common B-spline interpolation kernels (quadratic and cubic), $\mathbf{D}_p$ has a constant value: $$ $$
 **Quadratic B-spline**: $\mathbf{D}_p = \frac{1}{4} \Delta x^2 \mathbf{I}$ $$ $$
 **Cubic B-spline**: $\mathbf{D}_p = \frac{1}{3} \Delta x^2 \mathbf{I}$ $$ $$
Thus, $\mathbf{D}_p^{-1}$ is simply a constant scaling factor and need not be recomputed per particle. $$ $$
APIC significantly reduces dissipation compared to PIC by capturing local rotational and shear effects through affine velocity fields, while also preserving angular momentum. Although it requires storing an additional local matrix $\mathbf{C}_p$ per particle and computing particle-to-grid moment contributions, the cost is modest in practice.
