## Summary

We have explored the versatility of the [Position-Based Dynamics Framework](./lec31.2-core_framework.md) through various constraint types that enable simulation of diverse physical systems. **Distance constraints** provide [cloth stretching and bending resistance](./lec32.1-pbd_cloth_constraints.md), while **unilateral inequality constraints** handle [contact and friction](./lec32.2-pbd_collisions_constraints.md) at the position level. **Volume conservation constraints** maintain incompressibility through [tetrahedral and global volume preservation](./lec32.3-pbd_volume_constraints.md), and **density constraints** enable [position-based fluid simulation](./lec32.4-position_based_fluids.md) with SPH-based kernels. Finally, **continuum mechanics-based constraints** bridge PBD with [hyperelastic material models](./lec32.5-pbd_continuum.md) through strain energy formulations and direct strain component control. Together, these constraint types demonstrate PBD's unified approach to simulating cloth, fluids, soft bodies, and contact phenomena within a single, efficient framework.
